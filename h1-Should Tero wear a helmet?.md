### 1.1 Threat modelling manifesto

•	Definition of thread modelling  
    - Thread modelling is a process that models and analyses representations of systems to identify and address potential security and privacy concerns associated with them.  
    
•	Threat modelling process  
    - At its highest level, attempts to answer 4 key questions:  
    1. What are we working on?  
    2. What can go wrong?  
    3. What are we going to do about it?  
    4. Did we do a good enough job?  
    
•	Purpose of threat modelling  
    - Helps identify potential threats or issues to be addressed and mitigated  
    - Informs decision making in system design, development, testing and post-deployment phases     
    - Helps improve security and privacy of a system throughout its development phases and lifetime  
    - Outcomes should provide value to stakeholders, match with relevant development practices and align with the organization’s goals  
    
•	The threat modelling manifesto  
    - The manifesto serves as a conceptual guide for refining and producing more effective thread modelling methodologies, suited for individual needs.   
    - The manifesto is a set of ideas, and it is not tied to any specific methodology or framework nor does it provide concrete step-by-step/ how-to guides for thread modelling 
      (cf. Agile principles)  
    - The manifesto defines a list of relative “values”, where items on the left are valued over items on the right:  
        -Finding and fixing design issues over checkbox compliance  
        -People and collaboration over processes, methodologies or tools  
        -Understanding over security or privacy snapshot  
        -Thread modelling implementation over discussions about it  
        -Continuous refinement over single delivery    
    - The manifesto also provides a list of “principles” which serve as axioms/ fundamental truths on which threat modelling is based upon:  
        A) Primary principles that enable successful threat modelling  
        B) Highly recommended patterns  
            - Systematic approach, Informed creativity, Varied viewpoints, Useful toolkit, theory into practice  
        C) Patterns to avoid (anti-patterns)  
            - Hero threat modeler, Admiration of the problem, Overfocus on details, Single perfect representation
