### Installing Debian on Virtualbox 

•	Choosing the correct ISO image version ensures compatibility with the underlying system / physical hardware. Live version allows to boot Debian/Linux and test its compatibility with your system before installation. 
•	Virtualbox is virtualization software that’s used to create and manage VMs – environments where  guest OS can be installed and run (Virtualbox.org, 2019). 
•	For the VM, choosing a sufficient amount of RAM translates to better performance, though the RAM on the physical machine sets the upper limit. Storage/VHD, if dynamically allocated, uses only the disk space needed (vs. pre-allocating space). This saves space on the host system, even if a larger number of GBs are allocated for the VM. The ISO image is inserted as the virtual cdrom, from which to boot the VM.  
•	Booting to live version allows to test (e.g. network, display, hardware) the Linux/Debian before installation. 
•	When installing new OS on a real (non-virtual) computer with other pre-existing OS, backups (before installation) should be made to avoid data loss resulting from e.g., reformatting the disk, partition or setting overrides etc. The backups allow restoring the system, files and configurations in case of installation mistakes or failure. 
•	When installing the Linux/Debian on the VM (which is empty), partitioning erases existing data on the disk for clean OS installation. Encryption isn’t necessary because the virtual environment is isolated, can be easily reset/recreated and it usually doesn’t store long-term data. Since the host system should be encrypted, the virtual machine, which is a file on the host system, should be also protected as a result. With the user account creation step, security hygiene guidelines should be followed to create a strong password. The account will have sudo (admin) privileges on the VM.
•	After installation, updating and upgrading packages to the latest versions should be done for e.g. ensuring the compatibility of software components and security patches to fix vulnerabilities. A firewall should also be installed for network security.
•	Similar to backups, taking snapshots of the VM at different points, allow quick restoration of the previous state in case something goes wrong with the current state.

### Command Line Basics Revisited

The command line in Linux is useful for convenience, fast execution and automation.

Directory structure
- Linux’s directory structure is organized into a tree-like hierarchy, where the root directory `/`is at the top of the filesystem. All other directories and files branch out from the root, so everything is under  `/`.
- Key directories, such as `/home` (user directories), `/etc` (system settings). `/var`(system logs) are sub-directories under the root.
- A home directory `/home/<user>/`is the default login directory of a user and the location where the user can store their files or make settings (unless their privileges are temporarily elevated with `sudo`). The working directory is the current directory location of the user withing the tree.  

Privileges (access control)
- Principle of least privilege should always be followed. Using `sudo` for elevated privileges (temp) should only be used if necessary. 
- Sudo privileges are required for commands affecting the whole system (installations, privilege management, user management etc.)

Help with commands
- `man <command>` display man -pages for information about the command and its options & parameters/arguments
-	`-h` or `--help` brief built-in help for commands
-	`tab` autofill a command or display a list of possible commands (based on what’s written on the prompt)

Commands for navigation and viewing contents:
-	`pwd` display working directory
-	`cd` navigate / move around the directory tree
-	`ls` list contents of current directory, `less` view contents of a text file
-	`| less` control output with piping 

Commands for create, rename, copy or delete files / directories
-	Files can be created with text editors such as `nano` or `pico`
-	Files can have any suffix, and they don’t need to be given a suffix as Linux determines the file type based on its content. 
-	`mkdir` create a new directory
-	`mv` move or rename file / directory
-	`cp` copy  file or directory
-	`rm` remove file
-	`rmdir` remove empty directory, `rmdir -r` remove directory and its contents recursively

Commands for remote control
- `ssh` establish secure connection
- `scp`or `sftp` securely copy files or dirs between local and remote machine

Commands for package management & installations
-	Package management tools: `apt-get` high-level management, `dpkg` low-level management (GeeksforGeeks, 2022).
-	`sudo apt-get <update or upgrade>` update package list or upgrade existing packages to latest versions
-	`sudo apt-get install` install a software/package
-	`apt-cache search` search for a package with keyword
-	`sudo apt-get purge` remove a package & its settings
